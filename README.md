# 🚀 **Customer Churn Prediction — Production-Style ML Pipeline**

End-to-end machine learning system that predicts telecom customer churn and translates model outputs into actionable business retention strategies.

Built with a strong focus on **reproducibility, modular pipelines, model evaluation, and real-world deployment readiness**.

---

## 🧠 **Why This Project Matters**

Customer churn directly impacts revenue in subscription businesses.
This system enables companies to:

* Identify high-risk customers early
* Understand drivers behind churn
* Launch targeted retention campaigns

> Retaining existing customers is significantly cheaper than acquiring new ones — predictive retention directly improves profitability.

## 📊 **Dataset**

**IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset**
7,043 telecom customers with 20+ behavioral & financial features.

### **Feature Categories**

* Demographics
* Service subscriptions
* Contract & billing information
* Usage patterns
* Monthly & total charges

**Target:** Customer Churn (binary classification)

Class imbalance present (~26% churn).

## 📈 **Results**

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall   | F1       | ROC-AUC  |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.80     | 0.67      | 0.55     | 0.60     | 0.85     |
| Decision Tree       | 0.78     | 0.61      | 0.57     | 0.59     | 0.76     |
| **Random Forest**   | **0.82** | **0.71**  | **0.58** | **0.64** | **0.86** |
| Gradient Boosting   | 0.81     | 0.69      | 0.57     | 0.63     | 0.85     |
| XGBoost             | 0.82     | 0.70      | 0.58     | 0.64     | 0.86     |

### **Best Model: Random Forest**

* ROC-AUC: 0.8598
* Precision: 71%
* Recall on churners: 58%

Trade-off: Increasing recall reduces missed churners but increases false positives — an important business decision.

---

## 💡 **Key Business Insights**

* Month-to-month contracts show highest churn risk
* First 12 months are critical retention window
* Fiber customers demonstrate elevated churn
* Higher monthly charges correlate with churn
* Tech support significantly reduces churn probability
