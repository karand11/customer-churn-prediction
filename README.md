🚀 Customer Churn Prediction — Production-Style ML Pipeline

End-to-end machine learning system that predicts telecom customer churn and translates model outputs into actionable business retention strategies.

Built with a strong focus on reproducibility, modular pipelines, model evaluation, and real-world deployment readiness.

🧠 Why This Project Matters

Customer churn directly impacts revenue in subscription businesses.
This system enables companies to:

Identify high-risk customers early

Understand drivers behind churn

Launch targeted retention campaigns

Retaining existing customers is significantly cheaper than acquiring new ones — predictive retention directly improves profitability.

🏗️ What I Built
✔ End-to-End ML Workflow

Data ingestion & preprocessing pipeline

Feature engineering experiments

Multi-model training & comparison

Model evaluation with business interpretation

Reusable prediction interface

Production-style project structure

✔ Engineering Highlights

Modular pipeline architecture (src/)

Serialized preprocessing + model artifacts

Reproducible training workflow

Separation of notebooks vs production code

Model comparison with standardized metrics

Business-driven evaluation beyond accuracy

📊 Dataset

IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset
7,043 telecom customers with 20+ behavioral & financial features.

📈 Results
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	0.80	0.67	0.55	0.60	0.85
Decision Tree	0.78	0.61	0.57	0.59	0.76
Random Forest	0.82	0.71	0.58	0.64	0.86
Gradient Boosting	0.81	0.69	0.57	0.63	0.85
XGBoost	0.82	0.70	0.58	0.64	0.86
Best Model: Random Forest

ROC-AUC: 0.8598

Precision: 71%

Recall on churners: 58%

Trade-off: Higher recall would reduce missed churners but increase false positives — important business decision point.

💡 Key Business Insights

Month-to-month contracts have highest churn risk

First 12 months are critical retention window

Fiber customers show elevated churn patterns

Higher monthly charges correlate with churn

Tech support significantly reduces churn risk
